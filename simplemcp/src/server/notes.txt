Monkeys:
Monkeys are divided into two main groups: Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (found in Central and South America). New World monkeys have prehensile tails that can grip like an extra hand, while Old World monkeys do not.
Capuchin monkeys are known for their intelligence and tool use. They can use stones to crack open nuts, sticks to extract insects, and have even been observed using leaves as sponges to soak up water.
The smallest monkey in the world is the pygmy marmoset, weighing only about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) and measuring around 5-6 inches in body length. They live in the Amazon rainforest and primarily eat tree sap.
Japanese macaques (snow monkeys) are famous for bathing in hot springs during winter. They've learned this behavior culturally - it started with one female in the 1960s and spread throughout the troop over generations.
Monkeys have complex social structures and communication systems. Many species use different alarm calls to warn about specific types of predators - they have distinct calls for eagles, snakes, and leopards, allowing other monkeys to respond appropriately.
